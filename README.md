# rileyjshawâ€™s dotfiles

Things I've written or picked up over the years, mashed up with selections from [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git)'s dotfiles!

You can add a file called `.secrets` if you want to keep some things off of GitHub.

I use a Mac with iTerm 2 and tmux and stuff.
