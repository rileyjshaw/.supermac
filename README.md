# rileyjshawâ€™s dotfiles

Things I've written or picked up over the years, mashed up with selections from [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git)'s dotfiles!

Before you run `./bootstrap.sh`, you'll want to add the following to `.secrets`:

```bash
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Your Name"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="your@email.com"
```

I use a Mac with iTerm 2 and tmux and stuff.
